4. What is he Difference between HTML Elemnts And Tags?

HTML Elements
Element is a particular piece or portion of a webpage represented by HTML. In addition to improving the general structure and semantics of the text, it defines the structure and content of that section. With few exceptions for self-closing tags, HTML elements are defined by their start, content, and end tags. A hierarchy can be formed by items containing other components. Each HTML element on a webpage has a unique purpose and has a distinct meaning.
The names of HTML elements, such as p>, h1>, div>, img>, etc., describe what they are. These names stand for various website elements or semantic parts.
HTML Tags
HTML tags are markup characters that specify the beginning and end of an HTML element. Angle brackets (>), which make up tags, are positioned around the names of elements to provide a valid HTML structure. They specify an element's limits within an HTML page.
Opening tags and closing tags are the two different categories of HTML tags. An element's beginning and finish are indicated by the opening and closing tags, respectively. Some elements, referred to as self-closing elements, can be expressed as a single tag and don't need a closing tag.

5. How can you make text appear in monospace font in HTML?
The <tt> HTML element creates inline text which is presented using the user agent's default monospace font face.
<tt> tag creates an inline text which is displayed in monospace or fixed-width font as it would appear on a teletype or typewriter.
The terms monotype, monospace, and non-proportional have the same meaning. They are used interchangeably and describe a typeface the characters of which are the same number of pixels wide.
Syntax
The <tt> tag comes in pairs. The content is written between the opening (<tt>) and closing (</tt> ) tags.
